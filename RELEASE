Release notes for GStreamer 1.6.0


The GStreamer team is proud to announce a new major feature release in the
stable 1.x API series of your favourite cross-platform multimedia framework!


This release has been in the works for more than a year and is packed with new
features, bug fixes and other improvements.


See
http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/releases/1.6/
for the full list of changes.



This module, gstreamer, only contains core functionality.
For actual media playback, you will need other modules.

gst-plugins-base
contains a basic set of well-supported plugins
gst-plugins-good
contains a set of well-supported plugins under our preferred license
gst-plugins-ugly
contains a set of well-supported plugins, but might pose problems for
    distributors
gst-plugins-bad
contains a set of less supported plugins that haven't passed the
    rigorous quality testing we expect, or are still missing documentation
    and/or unit tests
gst-libav
contains a set of codecs plugins based on libav (formerly gst-ffmpeg)
